# Code Fencing

In the following Node.js sample code, the event module includes an EventEmitter class that can be used to raise and handle custom events.

```javascript
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

function c1() {
	console.log('an event occurred!');
}

function c2() {
	console.log('yet another event occurred!');
}

myEmitter.on('eventOne', c1); // Register for eventOne
myEmitter.on('eventOne', c2); // Register for eventOne 
```
